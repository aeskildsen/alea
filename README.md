# alea

A [Quark](https://doc.sccode.org/Guides/UsingQuarks.html) which extends SuperCollider's Pattern library.

## Patterns for aleatory composition

This Quark provides a collection of Pattern classes designed for aleatory composition, aiming for the sweet spot between randomness and control.

So far, the following Patterns are included:

- Pshunc - shuffle and truncate a list of items
- Pmarkov - a first order Markov chain
- Pxsum - create sequences of values that sum to a target value

## Installation

With [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) installed, run the following line of code in SuperCollider:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/aeskildsen/alea")`
